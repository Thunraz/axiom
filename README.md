# axiom

What?
-----
Axiom is a space game heavily under development. It uses Newtonian physics integrated using Velocity Verlet.
Right now there is not much gameplay (if at all) while I'm still working on the basics and getting distracted while doing so.

How?
----
Technology used: HTML5/WebGL with the help of [three.js](http://threejs.org/). Some ES2015 features (especially classes) are also used.
Everything is being put together using [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).

Where is it going?
------------------
If I only knew.
